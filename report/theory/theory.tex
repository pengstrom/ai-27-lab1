%\section{Theory}

%The A* algorithm is a type of best-first search using $f(n)$ as the estimation of the cheapest path through node $n$. The cost function is defined as
%\[
%f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
%\]
%where $g(n)$ is the cost of the path taken to node $n$ and $h(n)$ is a problem-specific heuristic estmating the cheapest path from node $n$ to the goal.
